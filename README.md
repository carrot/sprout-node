Sprout Node Template
--------------------

This is [carrot](http://carrot.is)'s starter template for node projects. It uses coffeescript for the code, and mocha/should.js for the tests. It's got all the files in the base you should need to get started right. It will also compile all your coffee into js and move the coffee into a `src` folder before it's published to npm.
